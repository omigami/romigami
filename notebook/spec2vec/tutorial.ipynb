    "\n",
    "This is a short guide on how you can add GNPS library matches to your mass spectra - using Omigami's Spec2Vec API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API uses a Spec2Vec model that was trained on the entire GNPS spectral library. It embeds each of your spectra into a vector space and calculates the cosine similarity to all GNPS library spectra in this vector space. It then returns you the top library matches for each of your spectra. To learn more about Spec2Vec read our gentle introduction: [Spec2Vec: The Next Step in Mass Spectral Similarity Metrics](https://www.datarevenue.com/en-blog/spec2vec-mass-spectral-similarity-metric)\n",

    "1. Specify any MGF file\n",
    "2. Run a library search through the Spec2Vec API\n",
    "3. Save the results as CSV."
